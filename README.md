# Asset-Tracking App

This app keeps track of your assets (stocks, crypto, precious metals) and gets real time price data from separate APIs.
Your assets are stored on local cache so they will be available when you come back!

To-De:
*refactor form
*re-enable and refactor API fetching with .env file
*set up database connection
*set up user login (maybe sometime...)

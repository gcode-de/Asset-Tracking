# Asset-Tracking App

This app keeps track of your assets (stocks, crypto, precious metals) and gets real time price data from separate APIs.
Your assets are stored on local cache so they will be available when you come back!

To-Do:

- refactor to use styled components?
- re-implement API fetching
- include search function for stock symbols
- set up user login (maybe sometime...)
- set up database connection
